Learn about system design interviews (SDIs) and how to strategically approach them.

A System Design interview is a technical evaluation of a candidateâ€™s ability to build robust and scalable systems. Unlike coding interviews, which typically involve a single solution, System Design interviews are open to discussion and involve multiple possible solutions that can be re-iterated.

For many software engineers, System Design Interview questions remain a mysterious challenge. Most engineers have never actually worked on large-scale systems before, so explaining how to build one seems daunting. Since System Design interview questions are often open-ended, it can be difficult to know the best way to prepare.

However, as someone who has participated in hundreds of System Design interviews, I can assure you there is a correct way to approach these questions. With the right mindset and preparation, you can feel confident and ready to tackle any System Design question that comes your way.

It is important to note that System Design questions not only test the technical knowledge of the candidate but also their ability to approach a problem, think critically, and make trade-offs. Therefore, preparing for a System Design interview is not only about understanding the technical details but also about understanding the problem, breaking it down, and finding the most optimal solution.
